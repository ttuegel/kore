{- | A pattern is 'Simplified' if it has run through the simplifier.

The simplifier runs until we do not know how to simplify a pattern any more. A
pattern 'isSimplified' if re-applying the simplifier would return the same
pattern.

Most patterns are assumed un-simplified until marked otherwise, so the
simplified status is reset by any substitution under the pattern.
