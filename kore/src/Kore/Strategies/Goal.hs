{- NOTE: Non-deterministic semantics

The current implementation of one-path verification assumes that the proof goal
is deterministic, that is: the proof goal would not be discharged during at a
non-confluent state in the execution of a non-deterministic semantics. (Often
this means that the definition is simply deterministic.) As a result, given the
non-deterministic definition

> module ABC
>   import DOMAINS
>   syntax S ::= "a" | "b" | "c"
>   rule [ab]: a => b
>   rule [ac]: a => c
> endmodule

this claim would be provable,

> rule a => b [claim]

but this claim would **not** be provable,

> rule a => c [claim]

because the algorithm would first apply semantic rule [ab], which prevents rule
[ac] from being used.

We decided to assume that the definition is deterministic because one-path
verification is mainly used only for deterministic semantics and the assumption
simplifies the implementation. However, this assumption is not an essential
feature of the algorithm. You should not rely on this assumption elsewhere. This
decision is subject to change without notice.

This instance contains the default implementation for a one-path strategy. You can apply it to the
first two arguments and pass the resulting function to 'Kore.Strategies.Verification.verify'.

Things to note when implementing your own:

1. The first step does not use the reachability claims

2. You can return an infinite list.
