{- | @TransitionT@ represents a transition between program states.

During the transition, a sequence of @rule@s may be applied; @TransitionT@
collects this sequence for the purpose of labeling the edges of the execution
graph. Use 'addRule' or 'addRules' to record the application of a rule or rules.

Use 'Alternative' to represent branching transitions, i.e. transitions from one
parent to many children. The sequence of rules leading to each child will
contain all the rules recorded before the branch, but each child keeps a
separate record of applied rules after the branch.
