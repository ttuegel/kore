{- | Simplify a 'Rewrites' pattern with a 'OrPattern' child.

Right now this does not do any actual simplification.

TODO(virgil): Should I even bother to simplify Rewrites? Maybe to implies+next?

{- TODO (virgil): Preserve pattern sorts under simplification.

One way to preserve the required sort annotations is to make
'simplifyEvaluatedRewrites' take an argument of type

> CofreeF (Or Sort) (Attribute.Pattern variable) (OrPattern variable)

instead of two 'OrPattern' arguments. The type of
'makeEvaluateRewrites' may be changed analogously. The 'Attribute.Pattern'
annotation will eventually cache information besides the pattern sort, which
will make it even more useful to carry around.
