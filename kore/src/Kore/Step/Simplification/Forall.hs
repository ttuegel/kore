{-|'simplify' simplifies an 'Forall' pattern with an 'OrPattern'
child.

Right now this has special cases only for top and bottom children.

Note that while forall x . phi(x) and [x=alpha] can be simplified
(it's bottom if x's sort is multivalued and alpha is not the 'x' pattern or
the identity function applied to the pattern x, or phi(alpha) otherwise),
we only expect forall usage for symbolic variables, so we won't attempt to
simplify it this way.

For this reason, we don't even try to see if the variable actually occurs in
the pattern except for the top/bottom cases.

{- TODO (virgil): Preserve pattern sorts under simplification.

One way to preserve the required sort annotations is to make 'simplifyEvaluated'
take an argument of type

> CofreeF (Forall Sort) (Attribute.Pattern variable) (OrPattern variable)

instead of a 'variable' and an 'OrPattern' argument. The type of
'makeEvaluate' may be changed analogously. The 'Attribute.Pattern' annotation will
eventually cache information besides the pattern sort, which will make it even
more useful to carry around.
