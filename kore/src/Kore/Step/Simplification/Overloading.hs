 If the two constructors form an overload pair, apply the overloading axioms
 on the terms to make the constructors equal, then retry unification on them.

 Tests whether the pair of terms can be coerced to have the same constructors
 at the top, and, if so, returns the thus obtained new pair.

 See <https://github.com/kframework/kore/blob/master/docs/2019-08-27-Unification-modulo-overloaded-constructors.md>

 If the overloading rules are not applicable, it would return @Nothing@.
 However, if it detects an unification failure, it would return a reason
 for the failure which can be used as an explanation for it.

 Note: this algorithm is used for both matching and unification; that is why
 the first and second terms in a pair are not interchangeable.
