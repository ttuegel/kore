{- | Execute a 'Strategy'.

 The primitive strategy rule is used to execute the 'apply' strategy. The
 primitive rule is considered successful if it returns any children and
 considered failed if it returns no children.

 The strategies are applied in sequence. An edge @a -> b@ exists between
 two configurations @a, b@ if @b@ follows by applying one step of the strategy to @a@
 Nondeterministic strategies result in nodes with an outdegree > 1.
 If two different branches converge to the same configuration at the same time step,
 they will be recombined, yielding a node with indegree > 1.

The primitive strategy rule is used to execute the 'apply' strategy. The

considered failed if it returns no children.

The strategies are applied in sequence. The 'rootLabel' of is the initial
configuration and the 'subForest' are the children returned by the first
strategy in the list; the tree is unfolded likewise by recursion.
