Description: A simple textual interface for building a proof

A simple textual interface for building a proof, offering commands
directly corresponding to the 'Kore.MatchingLogic.HilbertProof' API.
Parsers must be provided for the formulas, rules, and labels of
a particular instance of 'ProofSystem'.
