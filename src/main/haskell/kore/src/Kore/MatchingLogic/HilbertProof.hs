Description: A generic representation of Hilbert proofs

A generic representation Hilbert proofs.
The proof type is parameterized over a choice of formulas,
proof rules, and line labels, and provides a proof-building
interface that maintains a well-formed proof structure.
Checking uniqueness of labels and that proposed derivations
refer to only allowed (i.e, earlier) labels is handled by
code in this module.
A type class is defined and relied upton for checking
whether a given proof rule instance actually supports
a conclusion.
