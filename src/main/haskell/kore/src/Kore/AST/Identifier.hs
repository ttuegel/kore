{-| 'AstLocation' represents the origin of an AST node.

Its representation may change, e.g. the `AstLocationFile` branch could become a
range instead of a single character position. You should treat the entire
AstLocation as much as possible as an opaque token, i.e. hopefully only
the kore parsing code and pretty printing code below would access
the AstLocationFile branch.

{-|'Id' corresponds to the @object-identifier@ and @meta-identifier@
syntactic categories from the Semantics of K, Section 9.1.1 (Lexicon).

The 'level' type parameter is used to distiguish between the meta- and object-
versions of symbol declarations. It should verify 'MetaOrObject level'.

We may chage the Id's representation in the future so one should treat it as
an opaque entity as much as possible.

Note that Id comparison ignores the AstLocation.

{-| 'noLocationId' creates an Id without a source location. While there are some
narrow cases where this makes sense, you should really consider other options
(including adding a new entry to the `AstLocation` data definition).
