-- pattern consists of domain values, functional symbols and variables.
-- Hence, a proof that a pattern is functional is a list of 'FunctionalProof'.
-- TODO: replace this datastructures with proper ones representing
-- both hypotheses and conclusions in the proof object.

    | FunctionalDomainValue (DomainValue level (BuiltinDomain ()))
    -- ^ Domain value pattern without children are functional: they represent
    -- one value in the model.
    | FunctionalHead (SymbolOrAlias level)

    | FunctionalStringLiteral StringLiteral
    -- ^A string literal is the repeated application of functional constructors.
    | FunctionalCharLiteral CharLiteral
    -- ^A char literal is a functional constructor without arguments.
