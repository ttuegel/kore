{-| 'fixTopDownVisitorM' is a generalized monadic visitor.

It takes as arguments a preprocess function and a postprocess function and
produces a function transforming a 'Fix' object into a monadic value.

The @preprocess@ function takes as argument an unfixed object and works in two
modes:
* Left case:
    It transforms the input directly into a result and skips the visiting
    recursion
* Right case:
    It (sligthly) transforms the input into an object which will be further
    visited recursively.
    This case must also return a monad action modifier that will be used
    to update the results of visiting the object's children
    (use 'id' if you don't need one).

The @postprocess@ function assumes that all children of the object have
been visited and transformed into results and aggregates these results into a
new result.

Briefly, given a fixed object @p@ and functions @preprocess@ and @postprocess@,
`fixTopDownVisitorM' performs the following actions:

1. calls @preprocess@ on @p@ and,
2. if preprocess returns @Left result@, then it returns that
   else, assume preprocess returns @Right (p', trans)@
3.1 applies 'patternTopDownVisitorM' on the direct children of @p'@
3.2 applies @trans@ on the results of (3.1)
3.3 applies @postprocess@ on the @p''@ obtained from @p'@ by replacing
    its direct children with the corresponding results from (3.2)

{-| 'fixBottomUpVisitorM' is the specialization of 'fixTopDownVisitorM' where the
preprocessor function always requests the recursive visitation of its children,
basically resulting in a bottom-up visitor given by the aggregation function.

The aggreagation function provided as argument is a local visitor/reducer
which assumes that all children have been visited and
transformed into results and aggregates these results into a new result.
