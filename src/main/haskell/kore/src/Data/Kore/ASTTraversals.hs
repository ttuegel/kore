This module provides a specialization of the functionality described in
the 'Data.Kore.FixTraversals' module to the case of Kore patterns.

This specialization is meant to allow the user to write the local
@preprocess@ and @postprocess@ functions to be written directly at the 'Pattern'
level, although the visitation process takes place on 'KorePattern's, which
requires several layers of constructors (including 'Fix') over Pattern.

{-|'patternTopDownVisitorM' is a generalized monadic visitor for Kore patterns.
It takes as arguments a preprocess function and a postprocess function and
produces a function transforming a 'KorePattern' into a monadic value.

The preprocess function takes an unwrapped 'Pattern' and works in two modes:
* Left case:
    It transforms the input directly into a result and skips the visiting
    recursion
* Right case:
    It transforms the input into a pattern which will be visited recursively.
    This case must also return a monad action modifier that will be used
    to update the results of visiting the pattern's children
    (use 'id' if you don't need one).

The postprocess function assumes that all children patterns of a pattern have
been visited and transformed into results and aggregates these results into a
new result.

Briefly, given a pattern @p@ and functions @preprocess@ and @postprocess@,
`patternTopDownVisitorM' performs the following actions:

1. calls @preprocess@ on @p@ and,
2. if preprocess returns @Left result@, then it returns that
else, assume preprocess returns @Right (p', trans)@
3.1 applies 'patternTopDownVisitorM' on the direct children of @p'@
3.2 applies @trans@ on the results of (3.1)
3.3 applies @postprocess@ on the @p''@ obtained from @p'@ by replacing
    its direct children with the corresponding results from (3.2)

{-|'patternBottomUpVisitorM' is the specialization of 'patternTopDownVisitorM' where
the preprocessor function always requests the recursive visitation of its
children, basically resulting in a bottom-up visitor given by the aggregation
function.

The aggreagation function provided as argument is a local visitor/reducer
which assumes that all children patterns of a pattern have been visited and
transformed into results and aggregates these results into a new result.
