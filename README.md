# The Kore Language

Kore is the "core" part of the K framework.

## What is Kore all about?

In short, we need a formal semantics of K.
In K, users can define formal syntax and semantics of
programming languages as K definitions, and automatically obtain
parsers, interpreters, compilers, and various verification tools
for their languages.
Therefore K is a language-independent framework.

Thanks to years of research in matching logic and reachability
logic, we know that all K does can be nicely formalized as
logic reasoning in matching logic.
To give K a formal semantics, we only need to formally specify
the underlying matching logic theories with which K does reasoning.
In practice, these underlying theories are complex and often
infinite, and it is tricky to specify infinite theories without
a carefully designed formal specification language.
And Kore is such a language.

## Structure of this project

The `/docs` directory contains a comprehensive document _Semantics of K_
that describes the mathematical foundation of Kore, and a BNF grammar
that defines the syntax of Kore language.

The `kore` project is an implementation in Haskell of a Kore parser and symbolic execution engine,
for use with the [K Framework] as a backend.

## Building

Besides [git], you will need [stack] or [cabal] to build `kore`.

```sh
stack build kore
# or
cabal build kore
```

If using `cabal`, version 3.0 or later is recommended.

## Developing

Developers will require all the dependencies listed above.
We also recommend (but not require!) the following dependencies.

For setting up a development environment, we recommend:

- [direnv] to make the project's tools available in shells and editors.
- [ghcide], an integrated development environment for Haskell
  that is compatible with most editors.

For integration testing, we also recommend:

- GNU [make]
- The [K Framework] frontend, or [curl] to fetch an appropriate version.
  The frontend has other dependencies, most notably a Java runtime.
